# Data Science Portfolio
A personal repository containing some small data science related projects with the goal of learning some interesting techniques and algorithms.

The tool of choice is Python using the Tensorflow API in Jupyter notebooks.

## Content Highlights

- ### Google Machine Learning Course

	- Google puts out a free [Machine Learning Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/).  The following are a few highlights of the course.
	- Predicting real estate values using [linear regression](https://github.com/dhensle/dabbles-in-ML/blob/master/google_course/feature_engineering.ipynb) and [classification](https://github.com/dhensle/dabbles-in-ML/blob/master/google_course/classification.ipynb) of those values as high or low.
	- [Predict movies as favorable using text reviews](https://github.com/dhensle/dabbles-in-ML/blob/master/google_course/sparse_data_and_embeddings.ipynb) done with an embedding and a deep neural network
	- [Hand written digit classification](https://github.com/dhensle/dabbles-in-ML/blob/master/google_course/multi-class_classification_digits.ipynb) using a multilayer perceptron neural network
	- [Image classification](https://github.com/dhensle/dabbles-in-ML/blob/master/google_course/CatsvsDogs.ipynb) to distinguish between images of cats and dogs using a convolutional neural network

- ### Multiclass image classification
	
	- [Image classification](https://github.com/dhensle/dabbles-in-ML/blob/master/intel_image_classification/intel_image_classification.ipynb) using a convolutional neutral network to distinguish between 6 sets of pictures: glaciers, mountains, streets, buildings, forest, or sea
